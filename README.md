# DOM Challenge

## NOTES
* You can preview how the files _should_ behave by clicking [here](https://hstatsep-js.github.io/dom-challenge/).
* You will be writing your code in `index.html`. The rest of the files are for starter code _only_.
* The files in `characters/` are for `magazine.html`

## DIRECTIONS
1. Complete the `plan.md` file.
2. Locate the starter code of your DOM Challenge and copy/paste the code into `index.html` and work on your code there. This is what will be graded.
